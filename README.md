# hello-world
My own program for learning about repositories (eng)

To describe myself: 
I am relatively young and am most often speaking German or English. I am planning to do informatics in my later life, but aren't quite out of school. For this reason, I just code in my free time. 

Languages.in_order_of_learning = {
	German,
	English, 
	Python,
	C++,
	Java,
  HTML, 
	JS: p5.js
	}
